# Autonomous Vehicle System 🚗🤖

This project simulates the core logic of an **Autonomous Vehicle System** using a machine learning model to predict and control vehicle movements based on camera input and decision algorithms.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `drive.py` – Main script to load the trained model and handle real-time driving decisions.
- `model/model.h5` – Pre-trained deep learning model used for decision making.
- `requirement.txt` – Python dependencies required to run the project.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time driving control using a trained neural network.
- Integration of camera input to predict steering angle or movement.
- Efficient model loading and inference using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Modular code structure for easy extension and testing.
